    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 10th grader with expirance in programing dating back to 4th grade, when I taught myself Python.</p>
    <p>In the summer between 5th and 6th grade I learned the Java Programing language, and started developing a varaity of programs.</p>
    <p>Then in the summer between 8th and 9th grade I taught myself C++, and started developing my own interpreted language, which I never finished, due to not wanting to have to update every part to version 2.0.</p>
    <p>Finaly in 9th grade I taught myself C, and X86-16 assembly, and started working on my own C compiler, X86 assembler, and OS, which still in a state of incomplete development.</p>

    <p>1. Event-driven programming is based around the concept of events, user inputs, and raised program processes, being bound to a function. <i>The I Have a Dream</i> app used the "On button clicked" event to play the sound.</p>
    <p>2. It is only semi-possible to coreate a app without event based program, since one can technicaly uses a process to await all user input at the begining as part of the INIT function, howerver such a program has limited capability.</p>
    <p>3. The <i>I Have a Dream</i>'s UI is made up of a button element with ta picture of M. L. K. Jr., a label to give instuctions, and a lable to declare who the picture is of.</p>
    <p>4. A cars computer's UI will most likely contain a map, some "Idiot Lights", the speedometer, tachometer, gas gadge, and radio controls. A vending machine UI will most likely contain a remain charge, a selection of options, and a refund button.</p>

    <p>1. The enhanced version has a image of M.L.K Jr. and Malcom X, a lable saying to one of the buttons below to hear a speech, a horizontal arangment containing the buttons which play the speeches</p>
    <p>2. 3 examples of computing inovations include GPS navigation systems, AI, and OCR for the blind</p>
    <h3 id="Q_2.5">2.5</h3>
    <p>1. I feel least confident describing the OCR(Optical Character Recognition) since I struggle to comprehend how those read the image. The hardware component I feel least confident describing is probobly the FPU(Floating-point Processing Unit)</p>
    <p>2. An example of a special purpose computer I am familiar with is a basic calculator, a computer designed simply to recive and perform mathamatical operations</p>
    <p>3. The "Connecting to the Companion" execution system is based on the language Lisp, which is transmited over the internet, and then interpreted; on the other hand Packaging the app compiles the blocks into Java, which is then compiled into Java Byte Codes, which are either compiled or interpreted on the machine. The Java Byte Codes run at a much faster rate than genaric interpretion, even if interpreted.</p>
    <p>4. It would take about 7 Megabyte(7*10^6 bytes) to store all the Harry Potter novels. This means that you could store a thousend copies of every Hary Potter novel is a 7Gb flash drive.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_2.6">2.6</h3>
    <p>1. The WWW(World Wide Web) is the software and data stored on the hardware of many interlinked computers called the internet, thus the internet is the router and the servers(Your computer can also be a server as far as the internet is concerned) and the WWW is everything contained on the internet.</p>
    <p>2. Social media streamlines comunication, at the expense of privacy. Social media has also reduced the average atencion span, and made poeple strange.</p>
    <p>3. I would not develop the Social Media, or I would just redirect it all to /dev/null. I don't like social media, and belive it is the root of most of our probloms with kids(under like 30, people are so imature) nowadays.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_2.7">2.7</h3>
    <p>1.</p>
    <p>2. It plays the selected sounds by pressing a button.</p>
    <p>3. I created this app simply for this portfolio, I had no other reason to create it.</p>
    <p>4. <table><th>UI Component<td>Event Handler Used</td><td>What it contributes to your program</td></th><tr><td>Truck</td><td>When Truck.clicked</td><td>It adds one of the sounds. I hated this so I chose annoying soundsl like a truck backing up</td></tr><tr><td>Breaks</td><td>When Breaks.clicked</td><td>It adds the other sound, a break squeeling noise</td></tr></table></p>
    <p>5. I went back to do this portfoilio entry, since we did not complete around the assignmet, and neither of us remember any problomes</p>
    <h3 id="Q_2.8">2.8</h3>
    <p>1.  An abstraction is a reduced complexity object(I use object as a general term to mean a physical, virtual, or conceptual noun or to mean the concept of performing an action), that is, an object which has been striped of it's details, down to a simpler object</p>
    <p>2. Some examples of abstractions include the word abstraction, since it is not writing out the full definition, and any programing langugage, since a programing langugage is not the direct machine code as binary, but rather a easier to read and write, human language adjesant collection of text, which the computer will de abstracte and run. In fact the machine code is still an abstraction since it is just a number, rather than a compleate logic table of every posible input, and it's associated output</p>
    <p>3. An assembely language and the accociated assembler is a great example of an abstraction, since assembely is a collection of strings(text) which will be assembled into the machine code, which is closer to how the machine functions than the strings are, however the machine code is still an abstraction, as I stated in my previous answer.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_2.9">2.9</h3>
    <p>1. 921 is 0b001101010011</p>
    <p>2. My birth day in binary coded as MMDD is 110010001</p>
    <p>3. The octal number system has 8 digets 0 to 7. This is in accordance with the base-didgets relation of for a given base N, there are N didgets, 0 to N-1. Typicaly if the base exceeds 10 then the extra digets are assigned into the Latin alphabet, then the greek alphabet, the typicaly into assorted characters from the ASCII code points. Hexadecimal(Base 16) has 16 didgets, 0-F.</p>
    <p>4. The next student is assigned id 0b10010100, and the 10th(Base 10) is assigned 0b10011101</p>

    <p>2. The OR symbol is extremly abstract, to the point were any of "or", "OR", or "||" can be considered meaning the same exact thing, none of which given any detail on what or does, meanwhile the physical circuit does not say what it does, but can only be represented in one way, meaning that an or gate is inherently an or gate, and is not controled by the constructs of language, making it less abstract. The logic table of an or gate tells us exactly how it works, giving us every detail, making it the least abstract of this collection of objects.</p>
    <p>3. The binary didget 0 or 1 does not tell us how anything works, it being just a value, and is therefor quite abstract, on the other hand the physical circuit of a flip flop is does not even tell us the value and is even more abstract. Finaly the diagram is a demonstration on how the flipflop works, and is the least abstract of these.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_2.11">2.11</h3>
    <p>1. A bit is an individual boolean value, stored in a computer, and is the most basic primitive in a computer. 8 bits are combined together to make a byte, which is the basis of computing</p>
    <p>2. Moore's law stats that the transistor count doubles two years, and by extension, processing power does so as well. This however can not be sustained for much longer</p>
    <p>3. The digital explosion is neither good or bad becuase while it makes new sciences, and technolagy posible, and streamlines communication with people further away, it also creates all the vulnerabilities due to the streamlined communication, as well as requiring a rapidly evolving system to keep communications accross the world private.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_3.2">3.2</h3>
    <p>1. If the value starts at 10, the value will be 11 after the statement, since it is a basic increment operation, adding 1 to the value of the variable, as a modifier</p>
    <p>2. The use of the variable <code>dotsize</code> insted of the constant 5 reduces the details, making the exact value irrelevent, just what it is for, which is what a person reading will actualy care about.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_3.3">3.3</h3>
    <p>1. The message 1000001 1110000 1110000 0100000 1001001 1101110 1110110 1100101 1101110 1110100 1101111 1110010 0100000 1010010 1001111 1000011 1001011 1010011 0100001 decodes to "App Inventor ROCKS!", a false statment, unless by "ROCKS" they mean makes you want to hit yourself with rocks, in which case it is 100% true.</p>
    <p>2. JPEG being a "lossy compression technique" means that it reduces data size by trimming out sections which it deems "unnessisary", this however is visible, and reduces the quality of the image.</p>
    <p>3. The binary sequence 10010001 represents the decimal number 145, the character '‘' in extended ascii, the RRRGGGBB color which looks like <span style="color:#929255">this</span>, or a collection of seperate boolean values.</p> 
    <h3 id="Q_3.4">3.4</h3>
    <p>1. I placed this in a function, which limits a size change to only ocur if current size fits a condition. if the condition SIZE is LOGICAL OPERATOR to/than LIMIT then set SIZE to SIZE + DELTA, update the Size display string, and exit from this function<img width=400 src="https://emacsisbetterthanvi.github.io/MobileCSP/3.4.png"></p>
    <p>2. I recall no errors, however I am aware that some people placed x, and/or y in the wrong places.</p>
    <p>3. The picture disapers when th app is restarted because the picture was never moved into storage, and was left in ram, which is realocated, and cleared when the program is restarted.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_3.5">3.5</h3>
    <p>1. Everything should be refactored to be entierly in functions if one is writing an API, on the other hand, only repeated code should be refeactored into functions if multiple lines, or a complexed paramaters are used. One should not refactor x=x+1, but might refactor x=((x-pow(x, 2))/2+x)%a (A very bad random number generator).</p>
    <p>2. <img width=400 src="https://emacsisbetterthanvi.github.io/MobileCSP/3.4.png"></p>
    <p>3. Procedural abstraction is important in programing because it allowes one to have calls to a function, which they don't even have to know how it works, or sometimes, can not be done without calling out to an external procedure, such as parts of the X11 API</p>
    <h3 id="Q_3.6">3.6</h3>
    <p>1. Each row and colum adds up to a multiple of 2, thus we can simply add up each row and colum, and check if it is a multiple of two, and if not, then we know which bit was fliped.</p>
    <p>2. If two cards are fliped it is posible to identify which two cards are fliped, since it still has the other parity checks</p>
    <p>3. While downloading an executable file, particularly a binary program file, a flipped bit could change the value of the code, crashing the program in a best-case senario, and corrupting data in a worst case senario.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_3.7">3.7</h3>
    <p>1. The card trick used an even parity scheme to locate a card which did not fit the rest of it's colum and row.</p>
    <p>2. Adding parity bits to data increses data size, requiring more packets to send it, and taking up more storage on the disk, for instance if each bit position in a byte had a parity bit associated with it(one parity byte), and each byte also had an associated parity bit, then for 8 bytes one needs 10 bytes of data, a 125% of the standard required amount. It also requires a parity complient system or it might place the parity data in the wrong place.</p>
    <p>3. A checksum is a form of error detection which works by having an algorithum, such as the md5 hash algorithum, which is performed on the file, creating a short(compared to the file at least), string, which if it is equal to a known checksum, then the file is most likly error free(With significant amounts of errors some hash algorithums can return the same checksum, even though the file is completly different, however this would have to be a 1 in 2^128 (3.4 * 10^38) string with md5).</p>
    <h3 id="Q_3.8">3.8</h3>
    <p>1. A list is a usful abstract data type becuase it can contain multiple items of an abstract data type, such as Object or primitive, under one name, rather than requiring one variable for each item. Also, uniquly among data types, list items can be abritraraly accessed, while variables require a complex system in order to access abritrary variables</p>
    <p>2. One list which I used in this app was OBJECTS, which stores every value I used</p>
    <p>3. A user can add new destinations by adding an item to the list's, since it uses a location, a wikipidia page, and a name, which are structured into three sub lists.</p>
    <p>4.An API simplifies complex Programing tasks by removing the complicated parts from the program and reloacting it to a seperete section.</p>
    <p>5. I don't use my phone, however I know that google translates has a API which allows one to interface with it using put, and get requests. However google is bad at documentation so I am not fully sure how one uses it.</p>
    <p>6. GPS is used to determine where you are, this is done by connecting to geosynconous orbiting satalites, which have a prespecified location. Then the GPS finds the distance to the three closesest GPS satalites, and triagulates it's location</p>
    <p>7. <img src="https://emacsisbetterthanvi.github.io/MobileCSP/3.8.png" width=310></p>
    <h3 id="Q_3.9">3.9</h3>
    <p>1. Saying data are persistant means that they are not lost when the program restarts.</p>
    <p>2. Data in stored in a database is retaind until the database is cleared meanualy, or in otherwords, is persistent, while data stored in global variables is cleared when the program is restarted, or is non-persistent.</p> 
    <p>3. <img src="https://emacsisbetterthanvi.github.io/MobileCSP/3.9.png" width=310></p>
    <p>4. One enhancment I made is the ability to create, and persistantly store addional markers. When a point is long pressed on the map, a maker is created, requesting a name, and causing an update in a list of all the elements, their longitutes and latiude, then all the items are stored. Once the update is made a new UI object is created at that position to represent the marker. When the program starts, every item in these lists is processed, and a marker is created for them.</p>
    <p>5. I have handled for button presses, data base requests, a varity of other touch events, back button presses, list view item selects, however there are dozens of events, and I never intend to use any of them, since I don't like app inventor, some examples of which  include lost and got focus, touch up and touch down, and many others on components I have not even used.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_3.10">3.10</h3>
    <p>1. Metadata is data about a file, for instance metadata could include creation time to indicate how old a file is, or it could help password lock a pdf, securing the data in the pdf for a more secure file share.</p>
    <p>2. A model is a representation of a physical event as mathmatical equations.</p>
    <p>3. A raster image is just the colors of each pixle, it does not matter whether the data is words, or images, while the ascii representation is a way to store letters as numbers in a computer using a predefined standard.</p>
    <p>4. Filename extenstions are the piece after the piriod in a file name, which states what type of file it is, for instance a png file will have the extension ".png" while a ms-docs file will have the extenstion ".doc". Traditonaly extenstions are 3 letters long, since most were standardized by MS-DOS, which used the FAT file system, a 8.3 name.extenstion file system format.</p>
    <p>5. Lossless representation is a representation of any form of data which does not lose any part or quality of the data, while lossy representations lose some amount of the quality of the data. Lossless representations take up more space, but are closser to the original that lossy representations.</p>
    <p>6. Steganography is the science of hidding information within data, commonly images, such as injecting a name into the data for a image file. The algorithm for steganography used in this activity relies on the simplicity of bitmaps to hide a few pixels at the top corner of the image, with thier color actualy being the ascii data for a 3 letter word.</p>
    <p>7. In order to truely delete a document from one's computer they can either overwrite the entire file with some preknown value, such as zero's, then delete the file, or delete the file, then zero all empty space on the drive with <code>cat /dev/zero > zero</code> then delete the zero file, or the final solution is to move all files off of the drive, then use <code>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/{drive device name}</code>. If one wants a more secure deletion, you could use /dev/urandom, then /dev/zero, making sure to delete the file in between drive free space overwrites.</p>
    <p>8. Free and open source software is software which one can view the source code, free of charge, an example of this is firefox, which is hosted as a git reposotory at <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source">https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source</a></p>
    <p>1. Retouching allows for the modification of photographic evidence that will be presented in court, and similar problems.</p>
    <p>2. I would rather own a camera which does not messure quality in mega-pixels, since I am not a beliver in everthing being technolagy. I have made computers fill every second of my free time not already used by other hobbies, and I still think that cameras should use film.</p>
    <p>3. An example of a computer model is useing computes to simulate how some medications are likely to react</p>
    <p>4. An example of open source software which positivly impacts society is GNU make, a program which facilitates easely building complext computer programs. It's source code can be found at <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/make.git/tree/">https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/make.git/tree/</a>. The main positive impact this has on society is that it simplifies the process of building most open-source programs, since it is just one command, rather than several.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_4.2">4.2</h3>
    <p>1. Timer trigered events, which occures every certain amount of time</p>
    <p>2. The procedure I defined in this program helps manage complexity by making calls to updated the location a simple function rather than a multiple part function calling two seperatate functions to be passed as arguments</p>
    <h3 id="Q_4.3">4.3</h3>
    <p>1. Empethize maps to investigating, since that is the goal of investigating, finda  problem to solve, and empethizing is a decent way of doing this, define and a ideate are both parts of design, prototype and test map to them selves, since that is constant between systems.</p>
    <p>2. The enhancement I made was to increse the speed of the random location seting every time it is clicked, which adds to the challange.

    <p>3. I inspected the entire documentation on this, and I have no clue which reset procedure this question is refering to, so I will answer the question asked in the google docs. One would program this by having a touched event for the bad sprite, which causes the loss of one point, one for the good sprite, which adds 2 points, and a event for the canvas which causes the loss of 1 point, since -1-1 is -2 and 2-1 is 1</p>
    <p>4. To increase the speed of the image sprite, simply set the timer to triger more often to a maximum of once every milisecond</p>

    <p>A psudo-random number genrator can, though it is not very common, generete the same number many times, also a random number generator can have bounds, if the bounds were set to clamp between min 9 and max 9, then all it would output is 9.

    <p>1. The main difference between Bill Nye's solar system model and the Second Life model is the medium, with Bill Nye's model being a physical medium, meanwill the Second Life model is in a computer, and is capable of some addional tasks such as simulating orbit</p>
    <p>2. My hypothosis is that if there were a lot more wolves then bunnies then the wolf population would quickly crash after the wolves had eaten most of the bunnies, and soon only the grass will survive. With 10 wolves and 2 rabbits the wolf population crashed, but the rabbits survived, creating a sinusoidal behavior amoung rabbits</p>
    <p>3. Only rabbits, wolves, and grass were included in this simulation because the simulation is focused on the interaction between wolf population and rabbit populations. This introduces bias because it concentrats entierly on one aspect of the behaviors of the population.</p>
    <p>4. One benefit of a city fire department using simulations is that this system allows them to test multiple conditions, free of danger, however a simulation can only test the scenearios that the designer can think off.</p>
    <p>5. A model I use in my everyday life is ETAs of trains, which are calculated based entirely on past times, and locations. This captures the details of common issues such as other trains being late, or ongoing track matenence, but does not account for uncommon problomes.</p>

    <p>2. The fetch step retrieves the instruction from memory, but does not execute it, since that is part of the execute step</p>
    <p>3. Assembly programing is done using abstract words, which map to the various functions. Some assembly languages also support arbitrary other data types, which are converted into numbers during the assembling processes. Meanwhile machine language programing is entering the code directly as it will be processed in the machine, or at one level higher as hex codes.</p>

    <p>4. GPS navigation collects location and destination to generate a path. This data is sent to the servers which uses trafic data to calculate the shortest posible root. If this data was stored, or obtained by a person trying to locate a person would have no trouble finding the current location, or their destination, with paterns they could determin their life style, which is more information than most people what others to know about them.</p>
    <p>5. The privace act is not very effective since the government in response to 9/11 created an agency which is not effected by the Privacy Act. Also many other operarations bypased it through private companies</p>
    <p>6. I don't particularly care about privacy, if I was given the option I would probobly not give the companies by information, but since I am not really given that choice, I will wilingly accept my lack of privacy.</p>
    <p>7. Any and all interactions we make with any form of public computer system, and some private computer systems, leave a log of our usage start, and end times, when some events ocure, and where we were.

    <p>4. An intractable problem is a problem which can not be solved with in a resonable amount of time in a clasical computer.</p>
    <p>5. The nearest neighbor heuristic would say to start by going to point A, then to point B, and finally point C, however that is a 8.2 mile root, which is not the most optimized, with ACB taking only 7.6 miles. The fastestest root does not take the Trinity-Point C root, since there are far more optimal ways to return or start than 2.3 miles. BCA takes the same time as ACB, and all roots must return through a different pathway, since returning to an old location has a large milage cost. This therefor stats that the most efficient root is to start at either A or B, travel next to C, </p>
    <p>6. I use a heuristic algorithum on a day to day basis in the form of ETAs, it can't be solved for without a incredibly complicatied model, which still only can get a aproximation.

    <p>3. The speed up is aproximatly proportional to the number of processors</p>
    <p>4. The benifites of parrallel computing is that it is far faster, however most systems require different standerds for multithreading, and in my expirance the bigest challange with parallel computing is figuring out how to start the other processors because there is next to no documentation on how to perform interprocessor interupts.</p>

    <p>2. When a word or phrase is typed into google the search algorithum looks through a massive index of sites, which have been ranked by how relevent they are for each of the keywords, the relevency system is called PageRank. The exact structure of all of googles search algorithms is kept a secret, and as such is unknowable.</p>
    <p>3. A captcha is a system to prevent scam acounts by displaying images and requesting user input. The captcha's data is analized by the users, it sets the correct data set based on user consesus, or similar methods</p>
    <p>4. The architecture of human knowledge haas changed as a result of search by expecting the data almost instantaiously, if they don't find it in a few searches, they assume it is not obtainable.</p>
    <p>5. Figure 4.10 is a search for "falun gong" on U.S.A. google, showing a variaty of articals about them, and their website, while figure 4.11 is from Chinese google and displays articals about government action, primarily from news sites. The two figures are different becuse of Chinese google censorship, the former contains sites which China does not want their populence to see.</p>
    <p>6. The advent of mobile computing has made web searches into an extension of human memory, and knowlage. This has caused people to place the kind of trust we might trust in the librarian to be giving us the best resources available, and the option of all others, while in reality they might not be.</p>

    <p>8. A researcher can not place absolute trust in a search engine because the data is partialy based on how popular the site appears to the stear engine, but also is very easily manipulated.</p>
    <p>9. Most people search for their information via a search engine, however this allows for a search engine to control what data they get. This means that users could be easily manipulated by showing only what they want, or what makes them money</p>

    <p>1. Bandwidth is how much data can be transfered via internet specific amount time, measured in Megabits per second, or on some modern systems have it measured in Gigabits per second, which is useful to know how much data can be downloaded or uploaded in a second to determin how much time it would take to complete a download or upload. Latency is how much time it takes for data to arrive at it's destination, mesured in miliseconds, which is useful because it can make an operation take longer to complete due to how long the data is in transit for.</p>
    <p>2. Bandwidth differences are affected by internet providers, if the data is carried by ethernet, then the data densitiy of the wires, if the data is carried via Wifi then by the timing requirments provided by the systems.</p>
    <p>3. The digital divide is the gap created between people who can obtain internet and those who can't, such as created by social and echonomic standing, geographical location, and other factors. Some ways to reduce the effects of the digital divide is to make public wifi more freely availible and accessable in regions which it is not, and supply systems to access it. The alternative is to get rid of internet so that there can't be a digital divide, at least until someone else invents it again.</p>

    <p>1. The further the geographical distance between the source and destination hosts on a network increse latancy because of the speed of light, and time taken by switching between nodes in the network, such as is done to allow for multiple routs, and handling for packet switching</p>
    <p>2. Packet switching allows for handling a networking node being down, meaning that if a system has no power, and it would normaly be the node which data wuld be transfered trough, then the system would still work.</p>
    <p>3. In the situation where a packet goes missing then a request will be made back to the server for that packet to be resent, which would be handled by the transport layer, which would sent to the internet layer, which would, inturn, send data to the link layer, this does require the packet ID and the number of total packets.</p>
    <p>4. If all packets end up at the same location, then technicaly anyone can read the data, however often times the data is also encryped which prevents this, other methods include using multiple routes so that the packets don't end up in the same place.</p>
    <p>5. The primary benefit of making a computing system fault-tolerant is that one does not need to deal with faults in the system instantaniusly, but rather they can be delt with when the system administrator has time, with minimial problems.</p>

    <p>2. caesarDecrypt decrypts the the message so that it can be read, this contributes to the overall functionality of the program by working as the other end of the message stream.</p>
    <p>3. A function returns a value, while a procedure does not nessisarily. An example of a function might(I am using C)<code><pre>char * concat(char * str1, char * str2, int str1len, int str2len){

    <p>4. A global variable is acessable from any scope, while a local variable is only acessable from within the current local scope, or code block. A local variable is easier to debug because there is only one area in which it exists, and as such only that section of the code has to be monitored</p>

    <h3 id="Q_7.5">7.5</h3>
    <p>1. Files are used as a data abstraction so that we don't have to remember and type 91 kilobytes of data into the system, this is done by a rather creative feature of all modern operating system of a read/write file system, which is more interesting than the data it is being used to store.</p>
    <p>2. We use a multidimentional list, which is a list containing more lists, to store data since it allows the data to have multiple facites without adding an absurd amount of variables.</p>
    <p>3. Programers use APIs when their data changes constantly, or is very large, making storing it dificult.</p>
    <p>4. I do not have a image since app inventor does not work right, and gives an extreemly uninformitive error message of "Internal Error", when creating the polygons.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_7.6">7.6</h3>
    <p>1. Synchronous data operations are performed at the same time as the system requestes it, whil asynchronous requests are performed when the systm finds it most optimal to perform them</p>
    <p>2. False, cloud database requests are asynchronous, non blocking.</p>
    <p>3. The use of an external database abstracts the program's data, placing it in a system which is indirectly handled by the program and does not require complex database writing code.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_7.7">7.7</h3>
    <p>1. The system strugles with nearly identical concepts, sucb as left hand vs right hand</p>
    <p>2. A posible task for AI is some types of semantic error checking, one could state what the program does, and then the AI could check for errors. This fairly dificult for computers, but can be done, while humans are highly variable skill levels, which can change based on expirence, current mental state, or even blood alcohol content.</p>
    <p>3. An AI which anaylzes data in cities to assist in housing choice can in fact modify the housing market, an area which is far from the school for instance will not be recomended for familes, droping the price, and causing a feedback loop, this also would determine that poorer nighborhood might have a higher crime rate, and thus not recomend that nighborhood, selecting housing based on other data, until it could eventully start only recomending housing that nobody can afford, completly disbalancing the market.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_7.8">7.8</h3>
    <p>1. Copyright is a set of laws and permisions given to protect the permisions and decalre ownership of somehing, over copying, and redistribution</p>
    <p>2. Digital documents are copied every time they are viewed, or shared, if you share a physical document then the document must leave your posestion, while a digital document does not cease to be yours, instead it is duplicated perfectly.</p>
    <p>3. The peer-to-peer architecure does not have a client and a server, but rather has multiple clients which are also the servers. The peer-to-peer system may locate the fellow joined client+server systems, called peers.</p>
    <p>4. DMCA, or Digital Media Copyright Act is a legal act declareing how copyright pretains to a digital media object, stating what is fairuse, and how copyright law suits work when in reference to non-physical media</p>
    <p>5. Open access gives all people who access the object rights to use the object free of restrictions, and without terms, while creative commons is a collections of licenses, typical falling into copyleft, which gives certain rights associated with copyright without giving all rights to everyone. </p>
    <p>6. The Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license gives the the general righs for non-commerical users to share, and adapt the matiral, requirng attribution to the media in question, requiring the same license. Blown to Bits(Version 2.0)should be published under the same license, however I can not find data on it, however the since Blown to Bits is under a ShareAlike, and thus could only be released under a new version of the same license.</p>
    <p>7. Napster and Grokster were declared liable for the illegal activities becuase thier intent was to share specificly media, while BitTorrent's intent was to share any arbitrary file, such as user created media and other files.</p>
    <p>8. Netflix and Spotify have reduced illegal downloading activities, since they make optaining music far easiar, one only has to purches a subscription, but does not have to pay for each indevidual item.</p>
    <p>9. Jack Andraka was performing research on a mechanism to detect cancer, which is very important for the medical field. Many times research articals are paywall locked, which obstucts access, since a person doing research might not have hundreds of dollars to pay to 10 companies for a fragment of information, which they might be using to solve someform of problom.</p>
    <p>10. An app developer is bound to use exclusivly within fair usage of images and music, such as a clip of a song under 30 seconds(Fair usage via sampeling rules), versus a copyrighted image to give an example. Interestingly, media does not need be licensed for "Educational Use", such as in a research paper for school, with such an act instead falling into school policy rules.</p>
    <p>11. It is my oppion that YouTube users are violating copyright terms when the make lyric videos only if offical lyric videos are released on YouTube, or if they do not attribute the orignal creator(Covers should also have to be named x, orignaly by y, where x is the name, and y is the orignal creator of the song), I mostly listen to music through unofical YouTube videos, and thus I like the music being available.</p>

    <p>2. My app includes a procedure called "UpdateSpeachToText" which updates the SpeachRecognizer stops the Speach to Text if it has been started by this procedure. If Speach to Text has not been started by this procedure and the NoStart argument has not been set then it will set the SpeachRecognizer's language, and start speach to text. The procedure also sets the start button to the correct image, which it uses to determine if speach to text has been started.</p>
    <p>3a. The translation part, and the Text To Speech system works, however the Speech To Text errors out with the code "unrecognized method: Irritants: (SetLanguage)", so at least one part is non-functional, also for some reason it will not speack chinese, however that could be a system difference<br>3b. </p>
    <p>4. My code is almost fully refactored, with only one set of repeated identical blocks, which are simple asignment operaters of "SPEAK ← true (Set global SPEAK to true)", and as such it would make very little sense to surround them in a function.</p>

    <h3 id="C1.4">4. Practice Exam Questions</h3>
    <h4 id="C1.4.1">1. Program Design, function and purpose</h4>
    <p>a. This program translates one language to another, and demonstrates the pronucation of the language, with the ability to say a sentance for it to translate, which it hopefuly autodetects the language</p>
    <p>b. The program functions by sending data to the translation API provided by MIT App Inventor, then sending the responce to the MIT App Inventor Text To Speach System. The spoken input is handled by requesting data from the Speach to Text System built into MIT App Inventor.</p>
    <p>c. The inputs of the programs are a text box which can be typed into, or a speech to text system, which can be started by pressing a button. The outputs of the programs are in a text box, and audiable speech of the contents of the text box.</p>
    <p>d. The users of my app is people who do not speak the same language as another person that they are talking with, which they would use this app to get translations, and theoreticaly use it as a second person who speaks both languages saying their sentance in their language, which it then anounces the translation in the other language.</p>
    <h4 id="C1.4.2">2. Algorithm Development</h4>
    <p>The UpdateSpeachToText function uses an if statement to branch into two seperate parts based on whether or not the start button is using the second image or the argument NoStart was set to true, performing a reset procedure on the SpeachToText System by updating the translation, in spoken mode, stoping the SpeachToText, and updating the image in the button to the Microphone Inactive state. If the boolean expresion evaluates to false then it starts the SpeachToText system, and updates the image to the Microphone Active state.</p>
    <h4 id="C1.4.3">3. Erros and Testing</h4>
    <p>a. My Procedure should generate spoken output, update the image on the SpeachToText button, and update the text in the result textbox</p>
    <p>b. For some unknown reason sometimes the spoken output is skipped, notably when the target language contains charcters that the system language does not understand, also during an earlier version of the procedure it would fail to run, displaying the error "unrecognized method: Irritants: (SetLanguage)", which was fixed by removing a block which is not in this version of the function. The spoken output skipping could probobly be fixed by setting the speech language, however I was not aware of this field when I wrote the app.</p>
    <h4 id="C1.4.4">4. Data and Procedural Abstraction</h4>
    <p>a. The procedure idetified in part <a onclick='sth("C1.3_A");' href="javascript:void(0)">3A Procedure</a> updates much of the app, such as starting/stoping speach to text, calling for translation in spoken mode, and updating the speech to text request button. This is nessissary for much of the functionality of the app.</p>
    <p>The procedual abstraction remove all need for the usage the same segement of code, beyond a simple function call, more than once, while the data abstraction is mostly to carry values into events and procedures as arguments, with one variable used to cary a value into an event which does not support the required argument.</p>
    <h3 id="C2.1">Create Project 2.1</h3>
    <p>1. Femto can read user input, and from disk. It can also print to the screen. Further development of Femto will add file support, and additional commands</p>
    <p>2. I am using pure intel syntax x86 assembly, and as such I don’t really have “variables”, but rather a multitude of labels, such as the active disk, the SysFlags boolean collection, VGA_BASE, which is the base segment of the VGA memory for the associated screen, and VAddr, which points to the current video memory address. I also have numerous constants, such as BootLRD and BootLKF, which are informational messages, SCAN, which contains scan code set 2 scan codes, in the order I have in LOWER and UPPER which contain all the characters associated with given standard keys, in their unshifted and shifted forms, respectively. The ScanCodeToChar function iterates over SCAN to locate ah in SCAN. This is done using two cmp(Compare) and je(Jump Equal) instruction pairs, the first pair, which compares the current item of SCAN to zero, breaks the loop as failure if the item has not been found, and the other compares the current item with the contents of ah(Our target), and breaks the loop as success. The end of the loop has jmp .loop(Jump to the start of the loop) in order to loop back to the beginning if this item was not our target. If we did not have our “list”(it is just a bunch of consecutive data addresses, since a list is a much higher level concept), the ScanCodeToChar would be a several kilobyte long section(possibly even a megabyte of assembly). One procedure I developed is ReadInput which is a part of the standard library for Femto, and is intended to read an item off of the INPUT_BUFFER. This is done by pointing to the input buffer, adding the read head  to our pointer, reading our data, then moving the read head forward(reset to zero if it exceeds our buffer’s size), and then returning our data in al. Nothing is done if the data is blank. This procedure uses selection by invoking .reset if the read head is passed the end of the buffer(cmp byte [cs:IRHEAD], 32 and je .reset)</p>
    <code><pre>ReadInput:
    	push bx
    	mov bx, INPUT_BUFFER
    	add bl, [cs:IRHEAD]
.block:
    	mov al, [cs:bx]
    	cmp al, 0
    	je .block
    	mov byte [cs:bx], 0
    	inc byte [cs:IRHEAD]
    	cmp byte [cs:IRHEAD], 32
    	je .reset
    	pop bx
    	ret
.reset:
    	mov byte [cs:IRHEAD], 0
    	pop bx
    	ret</pre></code>
     <p>Code block which calls ReadInput, and handles it’s values.(.prompt is a label, signifying the start of this code block)</p>
     <code><pre>.prompt:
    	call ReadInput
    	cmp al, 10
    	je .exec
    	cmp al, 8
    	je .bs
    	mov byte [Char], al
    	mov bx, Char
    	call print
    	jmp .prompt</pre></code>
      <p>One procedure I developed with a parameter is print, which iterates through a string of characters, and moves them into the video memory at an increasing address. If it detects a new line, or carriage return it modifies the target address accordingly and continues. At the end of the function, if the address is greater than 4000, it moves all addresses back by 160 (One line), and retries the completion sections. This procedure uses selection in multiple places such as invoking the newline handler(cmp al, 10 and je .newline), the carriage return handler(cmp al, 13 and je .cr), escaping a completed print statement(cmp al, 0 and je.end) and accessing the scroll process(cmp di, 4000 and jg .scroll (The scroll process is sort of a subfunction, but still requires the same state))</p>
      <code><pre>print:
    	pusha
    	push es
    	mov ax, [cs:VGA_BASE]
    	mov es, ax
    	mov di, [cs:VAddr]
    	mov dl, [cs:Color]
.loop:
    	mov al, [ds:bx]
    	cmp al, 10
    	je .newline
    	cmp al, 13
    	je .cr
    	cmp al, 0
    	je .end
    	mov byte [es:di], al
    	inc di
    	mov byte [es:di], dl
    	inc di
    	inc bx
    	jmp .loop
.newline:
    	add di, 160
.cr:
    	mov ax, di
    	div byte [cs:COLS]
    	mul byte [cs:COLS]
    	mov di, ax
    	inc bx
    	jmp .loop
.scroll:
    	mov bx, 160
    	push di
    	mov di, 0
.scroll_loop:
    	mov al, [es:bx]
    	inc bx
    	mov [es:di], al
    	inc di
    	cmp di, 4000
    	jle .scroll_loop
    	pop di
    	sub di, 160
.end:
    	cmp di, 4000
    	jg .scroll
    	mov word [cs:VAddr], di
    	pop es
    	popa
    	ret</pre></code>
      <p>Two test calls for this function include printing the statement that the kernel file has loaded(cs:Color is defined at the start, cs:VAddr is a global variable, cs:COLS is a constant, cs:VGA_BASE is defined in the ConfigDisplay section, and ds is defined at the beginning in the BOOT section, thus bx is the only parameter passed)</p>
      <code><pre>mov bx, BootLKF
call print</pre></code>
      <p>This prints "Loaded Kernel file” to the console, followed by a newline.
My second test call instead prints "FEMTO>" without a newline, but starting with a carriage return to the console, being</p>
<code><pre>mov bx, Prompt
int 27h</pre></code><p>(int 27h is mostly the same thing as call print except it could call the other print procedure I have, however this particular case is set so that it doesn’t) This second call does not invoke the newline handler, but does still invoke the carriage return handler, by branching at different points in the loop(It should be noted that the new line handler invokes the carriage return handler simply by lack of not invoking it, however there is little choice for selection in this function). The procedure uses loops/iteration by iterating over the string to be printed.</p>
    <p>3a. Several errors have occurred throughout development including random jumps into the BIOS(These turned out to be jumps to non-code segments.), current results show that it mostly works, though the file locator is non-functional.</p>
    <p>3b. I developed this mostly during break, and had no user feedback from peers as a result.</p>
    <p>4. My code can not be further refactored as far as I know. Assembly is extremely dense, and might have the same set of instructions be used many times without a call being desirable, since one might have to set the same registers outside of the call. On occasion it is more efficient to expand one’s code than to refactor it into calls, space wise at least.</p>
